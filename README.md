# FSM-Based-Up-Counter
- A Finite State Machine (FSM) can be used to design an up counter. An up counter is a digital circuit that counts upward in binary, i.e., the output value increases by 1 for each clock cycle. 
- In this project, I have developed a verilog code for the implementation of FSM based up counter. Generally, An up counter is a digital circuit that counts upward by incrementing its output value by 1 for each clock cycle. It is commonly used in digital systems to keep track of the number of events or to synchronize processes.
- In an up counter, the output value is typically represented in binary form, and each bit of the output is considered a separate counter. For example, a 4-bit up counter can count from 0000 to 1111 (0 to 15 in decimal), with each bit representing a power of 2 (i.e., the least significant bit represents 2^0, the next bit represents 2^1, and so on). Up counters can be implemented using various digital components, such as flip-flops, logic gates, and binary decoders, and can be designed using finite state machines (FSMs) or other methods.
